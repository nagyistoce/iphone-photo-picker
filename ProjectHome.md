In the process of building an HTML5 application, we realized that mobile Safari does not offer any way to upload photos to a server. We needed this functionality so we built a simple app that may be launched from Safari using a special url. After a user has selected and uploaded a photo, this app has a continue url that is then loaded in Safari.

We thought other people might find this useful as they develop web-based applications on the iPhone so we decided to open source it under the MIT license.
